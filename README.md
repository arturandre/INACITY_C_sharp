# INACITY

This project presents a platform that integrates Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), image retrieval systems, Geographical Information Systems (GISes), digital maps and Computer Vision techniques to collect and analyse urban images. The platform, INACITY (an acronym for INvestigate and Analyse a City), empowers users allowing them to select a region over a map and see urban features inside that region that have relevance to the urban architecture context, for instance trees. The implementation is extensible and it is designed to make it easy to add or replace new modules, for instance, to add a new API to present a map, different GISes and other Computer Vision filters.

This implementation is based on the [Master's thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-04052018-170132/en.php) with the same name.
